# PufferAI (Forked & Modified)

This is a **fork** of the original [PufferAI repository](https://github.com/pufferai), with custom modifications.

## 🔧 Purpose of the Fork

The goal of this fork is to **extend the functionality** of PufferAI in order to:

> **Enable collapsing of the policy network for certain games using fiber symmetries.**

This allows more efficient training and inference by taking advantage of symmetries in the game state and action space, which can reduce redundancy in policy outputs.

## 🔄 Differences from Upstream

- Introduced support for **fiber symmetry-based policy collapsing**.
- Modified architecture components to allow group-invariant transformations.
- Custom preprocessing pipeline adjustments to accommodate the symmetry reductions.

> **Note:** These changes are experimental and tailored to research or applications involving structured action spaces.

PufferLib is the reinforcement learning library I wish existed during my PhD. It started as a compatibility layer to make working with complex environments a breeze. Now, it's a high-performance toolkit for research and industry with optimized parallel simulation, environments that run and train at 1M+ steps/second, and tons of quality of life improvements for practitioners. All our tools are free and open source. We also offer priority service for companies, startups, and labs!

All of our documentation is hosted at [puffer.ai](https://puffer.ai "PufferLib Documentation"). @jsuarez5341 on [Discord](https://discord.gg/puffer) for support -- post here before opening issues. We're always looking for new contributors, too!

## Star to puff up the project!
